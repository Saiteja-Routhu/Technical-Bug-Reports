# Technical-Bug-Reports
Technical Game QA Portfolio | Routhu Saiteja

Welcome to my Technical QA Portfolio. As a final-year CSE (AI/ML) student with a background in Python, Java, and Unreal Engine, I focus on identifying complex state-sync issues, UI race conditions, and logic-based bugs in live-service and gamified environments.

🛠️ Technical Skill Set

Testing Methodologies: Exploratory Testing, Functional Regression, API Testing (Postman), Mobile Device Testing (iOS/Android).

Automation: Selenium WebDriver with Pytest (Python), UI Input Debouncing.

Game Engines: Unreal Engine (Blueprints, Functional Testing Framework, Collision Logic).

Data & Logic: SQL, Pandas (Player Retention Metrics), Game Economy Analysis.

🔍 Featured Case Studies

1. [AFK Journey] UI Race Condition & Input Debouncing

Problem: Rapid user input triggers overlapping UI animations, causing a high-frequency flicker in the building upgrade drawer.

Root Cause: Lack of input debouncing in the listener logic combined with UI elements overlapping the "Dismissal Zone."

Impact: Prevents user progression and degrades visual polish.

2. [FitQuest] Gamified Ecosystem Logic Testing

Project Overview: A full-stack fitness application integrating AI (Pose Estimation) with RPG mechanics (XP/HP/FitCoins).

Testing Focus: * Economy Integrity: Automated verification of "FitCoin" distributions via Selenium to prevent double-spending or reward inflation.

Role-Based Access: Validated the "Cart System" logic to ensure Coach vs. Recruit permissions remained isolated.

Edge Cases: Stress-tested Pose AI accuracy under low-light and high-latency network conditions.

🎯 Technical Philosophy

I approach QA with a High-Adaptability Mindset. I leverage my development background to perform Root Cause Analysis—looking beyond the visual glitch to understand the underlying code failure—while remaining agile and ready to adapt to studio-specific testing protocols and standards.
